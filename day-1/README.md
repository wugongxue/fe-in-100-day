# Day-1

## Target

- Learn what is `HTML` (and it's tags).
- Know how to build a page with HTML tags.
- Learn how to use git.

## Resources

- (**MAIN**) Video [6.x HTML in detail](https://biaoyansu.com/6.x)
- Web [Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
- Web [HTML - W3school](https://www.w3school.com.cn/html/index.asp)
- E-book [Pro Git](https://bingohuang.gitbooks.io/progit2/content/)

## Tasks

- [ ] Build a HTML page with all tags you learn. You can build a [wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) page if you have no idea which page to build.
- [ ] Use git to save your code. Read and learn Pro Git as much as you can everyday during the course.

## Guide

### HTML file

You can create a page by create a file called `index.html` (or any name you want with a ext name `.html`). To view it, right click the file and click `Open with Live Server`. VSCode will open the browser for you.

`Live Server` is a VSCode extension so you can view your html page in browser and it will automatically refresh page when you update your code. For now, you don't have to know how it works, just use it. For more about `Live Server`, visit [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

### Git

You can save your file to git(a distributed revision control system, but, forget this for now) by running the following command in VSCode.

- Click `Source Control` in `Sidebar`.
- Add files you want to save to `stage area` (just click add button for now, we'll explain `stage` in future course).
- Input a message describe your change.
- Click `Commit` button.
